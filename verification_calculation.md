# Duality Verification for LP Problem

## Primal Problem
**Maximize:** 3x₁ + 5x₂

**Subject to:**
- Constraint 1: 2x₁ + 4x₂ ≤ 25
- Constraint 2: x₁ ≤ 8
- Constraint 3: 2x₂ ≤ 10
- x₁, x₂ ≥ 0

## Step 1: Solve Primal Problem Graphically

Let's find the feasible region and optimal solution:

**Constraint 1:** 2x₁ + 4x₂ ≤ 25
- When x₁ = 0: x₂ ≤ 6.25
- When x₂ = 0: x₁ ≤ 12.5

**Constraint 2:** x₁ ≤ 8
- This is a vertical line at x₁ = 8

**Constraint 3:** 2x₂ ≤ 10
- This is a horizontal line at x₂ = 5

**Feasible Region Vertices:**
1. (0, 0): z = 0
2. (8, 0): z = 24
3. (8, 2.25): z = 8×3 + 2.25×5 = 24 + 11.25 = 35.25
4. (2.5, 5): z = 2.5×3 + 5×5 = 7.5 + 25 = 32.5
5. (0, 5): z = 25

**Optimal Solution:** (8, 2.25) with z = 35.25 ✓

## Step 2: Formulate Dual Problem

**Dual Problem:**
**Minimize:** 25y₁ + 8y₂ + 10y₃

**Subject to:**
- Constraint 1: 2y₁ + y₂ ≥ 3
- Constraint 2: 4y₁ + 2y₃ ≥ 5
- y₁, y₂, y₃ ≥ 0

## Step 3: Solve Dual Problem

At the optimal solution, complementary slackness must hold:

**Complementary Slackness Conditions:**
1. If x₁ > 0, then 2y₁ + y₂ = 3
2. If x₂ > 0, then 4y₁ + 2y₃ = 5
3. If 2x₁ + 4x₂ < 25, then y₁ = 0
4. If x₁ < 8, then y₂ = 0
5. If 2x₂ < 10, then y₃ = 0

**Analysis:**
- x₁ = 8 (binding constraint 2), so y₂ ≥ 0
- x₂ = 2.25 < 5 (constraint 3 is not binding), so y₃ = 0
- 2x₁ + 4x₂ = 16 + 9 = 25 (constraint 1 is binding), so y₁ ≥ 0

**Solving the system:**
From constraint 2: 4y₁ + 2(0) = 5 → y₁ = 5/4 = 1.25
From constraint 1: 2(1.25) + y₂ = 3 → 2.5 + y₂ = 3 → y₂ = 0.5

**Dual Solution:** y₁ = 1.25, y₂ = 0.5, y₃ = 0

**Dual Objective Value:** 25×1.25 + 8×0.5 + 10×0 = 31.25 + 4 + 0 = 35.25 ✓

## Step 4: Verify Duality

**Primal Objective:** 35.25
**Dual Objective:** 35.25
**Difference:** 0

**Strong Duality Confirmed!** ✓
